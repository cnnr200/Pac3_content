Jeschke - these were all recorded by me and then edited so they wouldn't sound as much like crap; they're still not great, but can be usable in circumstances? think of them like muffled noises you're hearing from the outside, as opposed to good pure samples

Toiletrolltube - These were taken from https://www.freesound.org/people/toiletrolltube/, and edited slightly to try and reduce the background noise/raise the volume. Hopefully a lot of highs weren't lost. I stuck in a folder of muffled ones too (which also allowed for raising the volume even more)
